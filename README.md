## Introduction

> You Complete Me connects students in a mentor/apprentice setup. This project is focuses around the community at Turing, and the features/functionality lean heavily in supporting its needs. At the same time, efforts have been made to allow the application to take on a more generalized approach, that could be used to connect not only students, but anyone in need of a mentoring/apprentice scheduling app.
